Howdy. This is just something I made as a first Python project while I was doing my Bible school.
They wanted us to find repeated words in the Bible books, but the problem with that is you won't know it's repeated until you have already ready way past it.
So I thought why not make a program to find repeated words for me, then I could mark them as I read through the book for the first time.
I was having fun with the project so I also added a function that lets you find every verse in the book that contains the word that you input.
I posted it on Github to share it with some friends. I hope it can become useful to others as well

...though it's still not working properly, but I digress
